Operations include push (add) and pop (remove). A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) data structure where elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front). Operations include enqueue (add) and dequeue (remove)."

NoSQL databases are non-relational, have flexible schemas, prioritize scalability and performance, and use various data models (document, key-value, graph). They're better for handling large volumes of unstructured data."

It helps evaluate algorithm efficiency and scalability. For example, O(1) is constant time, O(n) is linear, O(nÂ²) is quadratic. It's crucial for choosing the right algorithm and predicting performance as data scales."

                    "sample_answer": "The bias-variance tradeoff describes the relationship between model complexity and prediction error. High bias (underfitting) occurs when a model is too simple to capture underlying patterns. High variance (overfitting) occurs when a model is too complex and learns noise. The goal is to find the optimal balance that minimizes total error and maximizes generalization to new data."

Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data without target variables, including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rules. Semi-supervised learning combines both approaches."
