# README.md
# Interview Practice App

A Streamlit application that helps users practice interview questions for different job roles including Scrum Master, Product Owner, Project Manager, Data Analyst, Cybersecurity, and Software Engineer.

## Features

- **Multiple Job Roles**: Choose from 6 different job titles, each with tailored interview questions
- **Intelligent Scoring**: Answers are evaluated based on relevant keywords and concepts
- **Retry Mechanism**: Continue practicing questions you got wrong until you master them all
- **Answer Key**: Review sample answers and key concepts after completing the quiz
- **Progress Tracking**: See how many rounds it takes to master all questions

## How to Use

1. Select a job title from the sidebar
2. Click "Start Quiz" to begin
3. Answer all questions in the form
4. Submit your answers for evaluation
5. If you get questions wrong, you'll retry only those questions
6. Once all questions are correct, view the answer key for reference

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`

## Question Evaluation

The app evaluates answers by checking for relevant keywords and concepts. You need to demonstrate understanding of at least 60% of the key concepts for each question to pass.

## Job Roles & Topics

- **Scrum Master**: Agile methodology, sprint management, team facilitation
- **Product Owner**: Backlog management, user stories, stakeholder communication
- **Project Manager**: Project planning, scope management, stakeholder coordination
- **Data Analyst**: Data quality, visualization, analysis methodology
- **Cybersecurity**: Security principles, incident response, authentication
- **Software Engineer**: Programming concepts, databases, code quality

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute additional questions or job roles by modifying the `QUESTION_BANK` dictionary in the main application file.
